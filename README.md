# Azure_VM_Sizing
This notebook was developped to assist a customer who needed to have the VM Sizes and Prices for all available Azure VM shapes in one place to assist with database worload sizing. The key metrics for proper database workload sizing include: vCPU, memory, Max IOPS, Max IO Throughput MBPS, monthly cost, Max Data disks etc.
Typical database workloads on IaaS VM are usually IO bound instead of CPU or Memory at the VM level. So it's critical to size properly based on the application workload IOPS and IO throughput MBPS. Azure VM size and price information can be found in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes and https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/; However the information is scattered in multiple linked pages which made it difficult to navigate and compare. The goal of this notebook is to combine all these information in one spreadsheet for easy comparison and decision making.
We use BeautifulSoup to scrap the information from Microsoft document site and also https://azureprice.net/. The final product is an excel sheet with key metrics for all available Azure Linux VMs. The code would work for future released VM size as well as long as the embeded size table in the microsoft VM size page has the same/similar column formats.
